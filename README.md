## Teoria.js with Music.js demo

I have so far trimmed back the music.js (https://github.com/gregjopa/music.js) demo code to only show the scales tab and scales tab javascript. This is an attempt to make a basic interface for Teoria (https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria) and get that working so to learn how to interact with teoria in order to build the interface I have in mind. 
There is something I am missing as I can't get the notes to display in the #scaleTable.

Please someone have a look into this, I know it's something really simple.

Thanks
Will
