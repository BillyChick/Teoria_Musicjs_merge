## Teoria.js with Music.js demo

 This is an attempt to make a basic interface for Teoria (https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria) and get that working so to learn how to interact with teoria in order to build the interface I have in mind.
I have so far began by trimming back the music.js (https://github.com/gregjopa/music.js) demo code to only show the scales tab and scales tab javascript.
The reason I have used the music.js demo is because it was easier to pick apart...
